OO Boot Camp using Kotlin for Canadian client, 3-13 July 2018

Kotlin is relatively easy to setup with IntelliJ IDEA. The following instructions are for installing
the code in IntelliJ 2018 by JetBrains. Adapt as necessary for your environment.

## IntelliJ setup
Note: The original was setup to use Kotlin 1.1, Java SDK 10, and JUnit 5-style for testing.

Open the reference code:
- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
  - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open"
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such. Confirm or fix:
- File/Project Structure...
- Select "Modules"
  - Tag src directory as Sources
  - Tag test directory as Tests
  - Click "OK"

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist)
